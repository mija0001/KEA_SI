--- Task ---
Create documentation that follows the OpenAPI specification. 
It must be more than a “hello world” API. 
Feel free to reuse APIs from other courses, work (if you have permission) or DLS.
(Remember though, that this is not showing approval that you finish the DLS project by just creating REST APIs). 

Recommendation: Download the page just to be safe.
