                <h1>Webhook system</h1>
                <p>
                    The webhook system allows you to register a webhook URL, to receive updates when a specific event occurs, since the system is just a demo and not a real system, only dummy and ping events will be sent.<br>
                    The system sends a dummy event once every minute, cycling through each event type, so that every type of event is sent once every 5 minutes. The system also sends a ping event when a webhook is registered.
                </p>
