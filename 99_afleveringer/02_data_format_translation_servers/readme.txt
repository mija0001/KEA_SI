--- Task ---
Create at least two servers (this week you can start with one) in two different programming languages with REST APIs.
Create endpoints that read the files that you created last week, parse them and send them as response.
You must figure out what data format to send as response.

You are allowed to split the responsibility between the servers if you are pressed for time.
I.e. ServerA reads XML, CSV. ServerB reads YAML, TXT, JSON.
